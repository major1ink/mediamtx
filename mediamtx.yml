# Path settings

# Settings in "paths" are applied to specific paths, and the map key
# is the name of the path.
# Any setting in "pathDefaults" can be overridden here.
# It's possible to use regular expressions by using a tilde as prefix,
# for example "~^(test1|test2)$" will match both "test1" and "test2",
# for example "~^prefix" will match all paths that start with "prefix".
paths:

  # example:
  # "121212":
  #   source: rtsp://admin:12345678@10.0.0.4:554/live/main/

  # Settings under path "all_others" are applied to all paths that
  # do not match another entry.
